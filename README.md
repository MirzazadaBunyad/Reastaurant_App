Hello. This project is a simple restaurant application and it is also my first project in mobile development. I developed this application using React Native (Expo Go), Yelp and Postman. In this application, you can sort cheap, medium and expensive restaurants, you can search for them with the search section and you can access their information by clicking on any restaurant. 
Thank you.
